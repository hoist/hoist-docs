#Deploying your first integration on Hoist

##Deploying your first integration

Log into the Hoist portal (portal.hoist.io) and create an application. When you get to the dashboard, you'll see a Git URL that you need to add as a remote. 

Open a terminal, and navigate to that folder and then run the following commands: 

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add hoist https://git.hoi.io/org/user/application.git
git push hoist master
```

This adds Hoist as a 'remote' to your git repo. If you're new to using Git, you can find more information about Git remotes here.

You'll see in your terminal a bunch of text, and at the end a 'Deploy successful' message.
