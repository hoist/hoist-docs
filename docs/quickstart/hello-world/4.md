#Deploying your first integration on Hoist

##Use your integration

Go to the dashboard of your application in the portal. You'll see a developer console and some information about your application. 

Open the developer console so you can see the messages coming in. 

Now scroll down the page to where the 'Endpoints' section is, and you'll see the URL that you created in the hoist.json file with a hoist prefix. Click that to open the link in a new window. 

Once you get a heap of JSON as a response, you can close that window and go back to the Hoist portal, and you'll see Hello World! logged. 

Congratulations, this is your first end to end Hoist integration.
