#Deploying your first integration on Hoist

##Writing your first module

Now that we have the basics of the integration configured, we need to add the 'helloWorld' module.

Add a file to your directory and call it 'helloWorld.js', and paste in this code: 

```javascript
module.exports = function(event, done) {

  Hoist.log("Hello world!").then(done);  

};```

Stepping through this file is very simple. You'll see a function attached to the 'module.exports' object that gets passed two parameters, event and done.

`event` contains the information about the event:
  - event.context is the context the event was run in
  - event.payload contains the event body and querystring parameters
  - event.request.raw contains the raw HTTP request information.

`done` is called when you're finished with the module. Modules will timeout after 20 seconds if done isn't called, but you want to make sure done is called, as your other calls will get backed up waiting for a slow module to timeout. 

Inside the function, Hoist.log is called. The Hoist object is globally available to all modules and contains everything you need to interact with the Hoist plaform. (Check out the docs here.)

All Hoist methods return a promise as well as accept a callback as the last parameter. So this could also be written:

```Hoist.log("Hello world!", function() { done(); });```
