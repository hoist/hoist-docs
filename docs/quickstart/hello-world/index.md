#Deploying your first integration on Hoist

##Overview

Deploying applications to Hoist is easy, and is required for many of the use cases you will come across. 

At a base level, a Hoist integration is a small node application. But don't worry, you don't need to know the ins and outs of node to get going. 

This tutorial will show you how to create a Hoist manifest file (hoist.json) which will point a URL that logs a message into the developer console. 

Let's get started!
