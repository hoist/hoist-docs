#Deploying your first integration on Hoist

##Creating your hoist.json

The hoist.json file is required by hoist to link modules, events and endpoints to each other. If you are simply consuming events without adding modules, then you won't need this. 

To get started, create a new folder on your computer and add a file called 'hoist.json'.

In it, paste this code: 

```javascript
{
  "modules" : [
    {
      "name" : "helloWorld",
      "src" : "./helloWorld.js"
    }
  ],
  "on" : {
    "LOG" : {
      "modules" : ["helloWorld"]
    }
  },
  "endpoints" : {
    "/log" : {
      "methods" : ["GET"],
      "events" : ["LOG"]
    }
  }
}```

Stepping through the code you see three major sections, 'modules', 'on' and 'endpoints'. 

The modules section is where you define the scripts that you want Hoist to recognize as executable. They requrie a name (for referencing them elsewhere in the hoist.json) and a src (which is case sensitive and should start with a ./).

The on section is where you define what Hoist should do when it sees an event. In this case, we want to run the module 'helloWorld' when it sees the 'LOG' event. 

And the endpoints section will generate a URL that we can use to raise events. In this case we'll be calling this URL to generate a 'LOG' event, which will in turn trigger the helloWorld module.
