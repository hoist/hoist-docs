#Raising Events

In your code, find the place where you want to trigger the Slack message. This might be when you save a record to the database or when the user views a particular page. 


Add the code from your language's SDK to raise an events. The event in our `hoist.json` was `contact:new`.

Pass in a message, as well as the bucket.

```javascript
Hoist.raise("contact:new", {
  bucket: session.user._id, //substitute for your application's session model
  message: "A new contact was created"
});

```

Node: in the Node.js SDK this is a promise.
