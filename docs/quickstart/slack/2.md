#Authenticating your users

##The basics

Hoist handles authentication for you, so all you need to do is provide the user experience to reach the 'Connect to Slack' button you'll add. 

This can simply be:
- a new page in the users account settings for 'integrations' that lists Slack as an option, 
- under Slack, show a button to connect if the user hasn't, or a 'Connected' label if they have

##Install the SDK

If your application is in PHP, Node.js or C# - we have existing SDKs for you to use [over here](https://portal.hoist.io/docs/sdks). 

Follow the instructions to add the SDK to your project, and set the API Key.

If you're using another language or framework, either [get in touch](mailto:hello@hoist.io) about getting an SDK, or replace the SDK calls using the raw APIs. 

##Redirect flow

When the user clicks the 'Connect' button on the integrations page, call the 'getBounceURL' method in the SDK, passing it:

- apiKey: the API Key found on the dashboard of your application
- connectorKey: the connector key for your slack integration (in this case: `slack`)
- bucketKey: the context id, either your logged in user's id or the logged in organisation's id
- returnUrl: a location in your app that we'll return the user to once they've authenticated.

Once the user can succesfully complete that flow, the authentication step is complete.
